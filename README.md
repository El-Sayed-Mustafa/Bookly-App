<p>
  Welcome to Bookly, a powerful and intuitive book browsing and purchasing app! Bookly is built using Flutter and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern with the Bloc (Business Logic Component) pattern, allowing for clean and efficient code organization.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Explore a vast collection of books from various genres and authors.</li>
  <li>Search for specific books by title, author, or keyword.</li>
  <li>View detailed book information, including synopsis, author details, and ratings.</li>
  <li>Effortlessly purchase books directly from the app using secure payment methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>
  Bookly follows the MVVM architectural pattern, which separates the app into three key components: Model, View, and ViewModel. The Model represents the data and business logic, the View displays the user interface, and the ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling data flow and state management.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, Bookly utilizes the Bloc pattern, a state management solution that helps manage complex app states and business logic. With Bloc, the app's UI can react to state changes, providing a seamless user experience and ensuring separation of concerns.
</p>

<h2>API Integration</h2>

<p>
  Bookly integrates with various APIs to provide up-to-date book information and seamless purchasing capabilities. By leveraging these APIs, the app can retrieve book details, perform searches, and handle secure transactions, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.
